Business Need:
One of the critical functions that we provide is the ability to add employees in our system and manage their
pay. Given a set of acceptance criteria, please:
● Write up any bugs found
● Write up 3 test cases
● Choose any test case and automate in the tool of your choice
This is of course a contrived example. We want to know how you would test and automate and get a brief
preview of how you work.

Assumptions:
● All employees have a base salary of $2,000 per paycheck
● There are 26 paychecks in a year
● Each employee is enrolled in a program from 1 to 3
● There is a $5,000 per year bonus for employees enrolled in program #1, $10,000 per year bonus for
employees enrolled in program #2 and $15,000 per year bonus for employees enrolled in program
#3
● The bonus amount is integrated in each paycheck
